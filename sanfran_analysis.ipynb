    "To get started, the first thing I did was to inspect the data for completeness. Luckily, there were no missing values. Using R in Jupyter notebook, I imported the dataset, then invoked the summary command on the dataset in order to get a high level understanding of the data. From the summary output, I determined the following:\n",
    "* Larceny/theft outnumbers all other incidents by at least three times.\n",
    "* The most common type of incident is grand theft from locked automobile followed by stolen vehicle\n",
    "* Most incidents occur in the Southern police disctrict\n",
    "* There was a relatively large number of incidents reported in June.\n",
    "* The total number of vehicle theft incidents was 1966.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this initial finding, vehicle related incidents piqued my interest and I decided to dive deeper into actual vehicle thefts. In order to focus specifically on vehicle thefts, first, I created a subset from the main dataset consisting only of rows with Vehicle Theft incidents, then transformed and analyzed it as described in the following sections."
