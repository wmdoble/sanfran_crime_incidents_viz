    "To get started, the first thing I did was to inspect the data for completeness. Luckily, there were no missing values. Using R in Jupyter notebook, I imported the dataset and then invoked the summary command on the **entire dataset** in order to get a high level understanding of the data that I was working with. From the [summary output](https://github.com/wmdoble/sanfran_crime_incidents_viz/blob/master/sanfran_data.ipynb), I determined the following:\n",
    "* Larceny/Theft outnumbers all other incidents by at least three times.\n",
    "* The most common type (Description) of crime incident is grand theft from locked automobile in the lacerny/Theft category followed by stolen vehicle in the Vehicle Theft category.\n",
    "* Most crime incidents reported in San Franscisc during the summer months occur in the Southern police disctrict.\n",
    "* The total number of Vehicle Theft incidents was 1966.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this initial data exploration of just reviewing the summary report of the entire dataset, I decided to dive deeper and focus on vehicle theft incidents for this analysis. In order to focus specifically on vehicle thefts, first, I created a subset from the main dataset consisting only of rows with Vehicle Theft incidents, transformed and then analyzed subset of data as described in the following sections."

As expected, the automobile is the most commonly stolen vehicle. The number of vehicle thefts does not vary widely across the summer months, but there's a slight spike in June. In conclusion, do not live in Ingleside, if you want to keep your car!"
